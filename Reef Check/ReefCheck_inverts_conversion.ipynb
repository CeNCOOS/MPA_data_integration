    "# Reef Check - invertebrate data conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "For each survey site, Reef Check performs 6 core transects where divers record inverts, kelp (plus presence/absence of invasives), UPC and fish. 12 additional fish-only transects, and abalone and urchin size surveys, are performed separately. For this reason, I originally thought it would be reasonable to have four converted datasets: \n",
    "1. Core transect data\n",
    "2. Fish-only transect data\n",
    "3. Urchin size data\n",
    "4. Abalone size data\n",
    "\n",
    "After some thought, however, I decided **it makes more sense to continue to group the data by organism type** (inverts, kelp, fish, UPC). The fact that certain organisms were found on the same core transect does lend a certain amount of spatial information. But because that information is not preserved across surveys, statements about abundance and variability only make sense at the site level. Aside from the fact that transects at a given sight must be deep or shallow, and approximately parallel to shore following a depth contour, there is nothing that ensures that transect 1 at site A in 2001 matches transect 1 at site A in 2002.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that the urchin and abalone size data should also be converted separately. These surveys are not conducted as part of the core transects, and it would be misleading therefore to attach presence or size information to the converted inverts data.\n",
