    "# Reef Check - transect data conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "For each survey site, Reef Check performs 6 core transects where divers record inverts, kelp, UPC and fish. 12 additional fish-only transects are performed separately. Abalone and urchin size surveys are performed off-transect, and only at some sites. Presence/absence surveys for invasive kelps are also performed off-transect. For this reason, I think it would be reasonable to have four converted datasets: \n",

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are sites listed in the inverts, kelp and fish data that are not in the site table. They are: Cayucos, Hurricane Ridge, LA Federal Breakwater, Ocean Cove, Pier 400 and West Long Point. I need the lat and lon for these sites. Also, is Ocean Cove the same as Ocean Cove Kelper? **These sites are mostly ones that were only sampled once. Jan and Dan will update the site table with missing sites. Note that West Long Point is the same as Long Point West. Ocean Cove Kelper is not the same as Ocean Cove**\n",
    "2. In the inverts and kelp data, both Distance and Amount are sometimes NaN. There are also records where Distance is a number (including but not limited to 30) and Amount is NaN. How should I interpret these records? Are NaN values different than 0 values? **If the amount is NaN, assume that the species was not looked for during that transect, regardless of distance value.**\n",
    "3. In the fish data, a good proportion of records have Amount = NaN (~17,000). In addition, for these records, Size_cm, Min_cm and Max_cm are either 0 or NaN. Which value (0 or NaN) is used does not depend on whether the Year is before or after 2013. How do I interpret these records? **Again, if amount is NaN, disregard size columns. Assume it is a true missing value, and that the fish was not looked for during the transect.**\n",
    "4. Also in the fish data, there are a good number of records where amount = 0 but a SizeCategory is listed. I've assumed that these records should have SizeCategory = NaN. (Note that this is not a problem for Size_cm, which is only > 0 if amount is > 0.) **This assumption is correct.**\n",
    "5. In the fish data, there are a number of problems with the min and max size columns.\n",
    "    - In a number of cases, amount = 1 and Min_cm and Max_cm = Size_cm. I've assumed in these cases Min_cm and Max_cm should be NaN. **This is correct.**\n",
    "    - In a number of cases, amount = 0 and Size_cm = 0, while Min_cm and Max_cm = NaN. I've assumed that Size_cm, Min_cm and Max_cm should all be NaN **This is correct.**\n",
    "    - There are also ~1000 cases where amount = 0 and Min_cm != Max_cm != Size_cm. How should I interpret these rows? It looks like in these cases, Size_cm remains the average of Min_cm and Max_cm. **As per Dan's instructions, I've handled all but 149 of these, which appear to be true data entry problems. He will look at it and get back to me. In the meantime, I haven't included any size information in the MoF for these records.**\n",
    "    - There are many cases where Min_cm = 0. This doesn't seem like a valid minimum value - is it? **Dan and Jan said these should be yoy rockfish, which are always entered as having a min_size of 1 and a max_size of 10. This has been entered very inconsistently, and I tried to find and fix all of the problems as best I could. After doing this, there are still 206 records that are not yoy rockfish and have a minimum size of 0. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THESE.**\n",
    "6. In the kelp data, there is sometimes a 7th transect. Similarly, in the fish data, there are occassionally transects numbering 19-31. When are extra transects done? Are they inshore or offshore? I thought that inshore transects were always labeled 1-3 and 7-12, and offshore transects were always labeled 4-6 and 13-18. Is this not correct? **This is generally correct. Extra transects have been done since 2018. It would be best to trust the depth measurement rather than the inshore/offshore category - get rid of this column.**\n",
    "7. There are some transects where more than one depth is given. Should I assume this is a typo? Or that two measurements were taken? **Dan clarified that the depths and visibilities recorded in the fish data should be considered the most accurate standard. I've changed the code so that depths/visibilities are filled from the inverts and/or kelp data only when they are missing in the fish data.**\n",
    "8. The values in the Amount column for each Category of the UPC surveys should sum to 30. There are 4 surveys where this doesn't happen: Isthmus Reef on 10-Dec-2019, Transect 3 (Category, Cover and Relief all sum to 60); Lovers Point on 16-Sep-2006, Transect 1 (Substrate sums to 31); South La Jolla on 11-Aug-2019, Transect 1 (Substrate sums to 31); and Stillwater Cove Monterey on 26-Aug-2013, Transect 3 (Relief sums to 31). Do you know where the errors are here? Particularly for Isthmus Reef, where there seem to be duplicate entries with conflicting data? **Dan has provided correct data for Isthmus Reef and South La Jolla. Lovers Point and Stillwater Cove appear to be true problems with the data that need to be traced back to the original data sheet; this may take some time.**"
