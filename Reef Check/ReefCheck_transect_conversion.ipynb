    "# Reef Check - transect data conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "For each survey site, Reef Check performs 6 core transects where divers record inverts, kelp, UPC and fish. 12 additional fish-only transects are performed separately. Abalone and urchin size surveys are performed off-transect, and only at some sites. Presence/absence surveys for invasive kelps are also performed off-transect. For this reason, I think it would be reasonable to have four converted datasets: \n",

So, for example, at 120 Reef on October 8, 2006, during the 5th transect, 4 giant kelps were observed. Correspondingly, 'giant kelp' has four rows, while the other species only have 1 to indicate their presence/absence and density.

So, for example, the occurrenceID for the giant kelp observation for the 120 Reef survey mentioned above would be 120Reef_20060810_5_algae_occ5, the density would be 4 per 60 m2, and the associated MoF would be type = size, value = 10|6|4|7, unit = number of stipes."

    "There are lots of complexities here as well. Following on the idea that the occurrence file should contain one line per species with a density per 60 m2, then it seems like I should have organismQuantity (density), organismQuantityType, sex, and lifeStage in the occurrence file. Sex and lifeStage will have to be separated out from the Sex column in the original fish dataframe. Then, in the MoF file, each occurrenceID can be associated with a density and size list (formatted similarly to the stipes list from kelp). Sizes will be \"Small\", \"Medium\" or \"Large\" prior to 2013, and estimated to the nearest cm afterwards. If a min and max size has been provided (as may occur after 2013 for groups of fish), these sizes will not be included in the size list but will instead have their own min size and max size row associated with the occurrenceID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that sometimes a subset of fish are sized individually while others have been given a size range (e.g. 120 Reef on 7/10/18, transect 4, black perch).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that there are a large number (~160,000) of records where amount is NaN. I'm not sure what this indicates. In addition, for these records, Size_cm is either blank or NaN, and Min_cm and Max_cm are either 0 or NaN. Which value (0 or NaN) is used does not depend on whether the Year is before or after 2013. How do I interpret these records? This also affects the calculation of density at the bottom of this section."

    "1. There are sites listed in the inverts, kelp and fish data that are not in the site table. They are: Cayucos, Hurricane Ridge, LA Federal Breakwater, Ocean Cove, Pier 400 and West Long Point. I need the lat and lon for these sites. Also, is Ocean Cove the same as Ocean Cove Kelper?\n",
    "2. In the inverts and kelp data, both Distance and Amount are sometimes NaN. There are also records where Distance is a number (including but not limited to 30) and Amount is NaN. How should I interpret these records? Are NaN values different than 0 values?\n",
    "3. In the fish data, a large proportion of records have Amount = NaN (~160,000). In addition, for these records, Size_cm is either blank or NaN, and Min_cm and Max_cm are either 0 or NaN. Which value (0 or NaN) is used does not depend on whether the Year is before or after 2013. How do I interpret these records? \n",
    "4. In the kelp data, there is sometimes a 7th transect. Similarly, in the fish data, there are occassionally transects numbering 19-31. When are extra transects done? Are they inshore or offshore? I thought that inshore transects were always labeled 1-3 and 7-12, and offshore transects were always labeled 4-6 and 13-18. Is this not correct?\n",
    "5. There are some transects where more than one depth is given. Should I assume this is a typo? Or that two measurements were taken?\n",
    "6. The values in the Amount column for each Category of the UPC surveys should sum to 30. There are 4 surveys where this doesn't happen: Isthmus Reef on 10-Dec-2019, Transect 3 (Category, Cover and Relief all sum to 60); Lovers Point on 16-Sep-2006, Transect 1 (Substrate sums to 31); South La Jolla on 11-Aug-2019, Transect 1 (Substrate sums to 31); and Stillwater Cove Monterey on 26-Aug-2013, Transect 3 (Relief sums to 31). Do you know where the errors are here? Particularly for Isthmus Reef, where there seem to be duplicate entries with conflicting data?"
