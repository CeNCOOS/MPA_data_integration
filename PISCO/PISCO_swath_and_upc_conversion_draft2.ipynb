For SUPERLAYER, the total number of points will not necessarily equal the targeted number of points surveyed in each of the other categories (i.e. superlayer is specific to certain organisms that are only included if present).\n",

    "- SUBSTRATE: Substrate type underlying each point. Substrate categories include bedrock , boulder, cobble, and sand and are further defined in the taxonomic table\n",
    "- SUPERLAYER: Superlayer includes a small subset of specific organisms which may be ephemeral, and tend to create a layer over primary space holders. Examples include low-lying, very large-bladed macroalgae such as Laminaria farlowii, brittle stars, and drift algae and in the Northern region abalone are recorded as a superlayer when occupying the space at the point. Not recorded at all points, only where present\n",

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**These questions are in addition to those listed in PISCO_fish_transect_converstion.ipynb**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do I know if an organism was subsampled? Have counts already been adjusted to 60 m2? **Yes, counts have already been adjusted, so don't worry about it.**\n",
    "2. What's up with the transects that aren't just numbers ('1_E', '1_S', etc.)? Should I strip off the letters or leave them? **The actual transect numbers aren't meaningful - they're just different to denote replicates. Dan agrees that they are a bit confusing, but the research group would like to keep them.**\n",
    "3. There are 12 classcodes in the species table that do not appear in the swath or upc data. In addition, one classcode, LEPHEXAD, is missing from the species table. **This classcode refers to a Leptasterias adult. It will be changed to LEPHEX in the 2020 submission.**\n",
    "4. Sometimes, as in the fish data, NO_ORG observations occur in the same event as other observations. This does not make sense to me. **This should mean that no kelp was observed on the transect. Dan will confirm, and I can look into this as well. -- This does not appear to be correct, but there's only one NO_ORG record, and for now I've just excluded it. The wording in Dan's follow-up email was a bit confusing, but I think he's saying that he will drop this record for the next submission, too.**\n",
    "5. I did not find any size measurements for sea cucumbers, although the metadata says were sometimes sized. **This is fine; sea cucumber sizes can be found in the size frequency data.**\n",
    "6. As in the fish data, what is an appropriate coordinateUncertaintyInMeters? **250 m should be fine.**\n",
    "7. Is there a samplingEffort I can list for swath transects? UPC transects? Like a time goal or limit? **No. Since these transects represent a snapshot in time, and the organisms counted are sessile, it doesn't matter how long it takes someone to search the transect. It takes as long as it takes to survey everything that's there.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remaining Questions - 2/4/21\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I'm still missing the lat, lon for SCI_PELICAN_FAR_WEST.\n",
    "2. Absence records are now populated, but there are a collection of situations where the species was not looked for in the species table, but appears as present in the data. The data sets swath_counted_but_not_looked_for.csv and swath_counted_but_not_looked_for_summary.csv contain the details for these instances. **Dan is looking into this.**\n",
    "3. Conversely, while populating absence records, I observed that there are a couple entries missing in the species table (i.e., there are observations of a given classcode from a given campus, but that classcode is not listed in the species table for that campus.) I need to let Dan know about this, and hopefully he can fix it in the next update to DataONE. Until then, though, I've added the following manually to the species tablew:\n",
    "    - LAMSETAD for UCSC, observations in 2001-2018\n",
    "    - LEPHEXAD for UCSC, observations in 2014-2018 (Dan says he's changing this classcode to LEPHEX in the 2020 submission, so this will need to reflect that).\n",
    "    \n",
    "**The updated species table for the 2020 submission reflects these changes, although Dan now says that LEPHEXAD will persist in the 2020 submission, so I need to make sure I'm handling that correctly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dan mentioned that he hadn't generated a separate set of lines for campus=OSU, so this may need to be done over again once that's accomplished. **Not relevant for this data set.**\n",
    "5. Before doing the final version of this data set, it might be worth re-visiting controlled vocabularies in the context of measurementType, measurementUnit, etc, especially for the disease observations."
