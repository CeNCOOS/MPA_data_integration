Percent cover should be calculated for each category separately. For SUPERLAYER, the total number of points will not necessarily equal the targeted number of points surveyed in each of the other categories (i.e. superlayer is specific to certain organisms that are only included if present).\n",
    "- COVER: Primary space holding, non-mobile organism or bare substrate type present at each point, cover types are defined in taxonomic table\n",
    "- RELIEF: Physical relief is measured as the greatest vertical relief that exists within a 1m wide section across the tape and a 0.5m section along that tape that is centered over the point. Relief categories can be 0-10cm, 10cm-1m, 1-2m, and >2m\n",
    "- SUBSTRATE: Substrate type underlying each point. Substrate categories include bedrock , boulder, cobble, and sand and are further defined in the taxonomic table\n",
    "- SUPERLAYER: Superlayer includes a small subset of specific organisms which may be ephemeral, and tend to create a layer over primary space holders. Examples include low-lying, very large-bladed macroalgae such as Laminaria farlowii, brittle stars, and drift algae and in the Northern region abalone are recorded as a superlayer when occupying the space at the point. Not recorded at all points, only where present\n",
