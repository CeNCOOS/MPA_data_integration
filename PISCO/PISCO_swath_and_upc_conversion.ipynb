Percent cover should be calculated for each category separately. For SUPERLAYER, the total number of points will not necessarily equal the targeted number of points surveyed in each of the other categories (i.e. superlayer is specific to certain organisms that are only included if present).\n",
    "- COVER: Primary space holding, non-mobile organism or bare substrate type present at each point, cover types are defined in taxonomic table\n",
    "- RELIEF: Physical relief is measured as the greatest vertical relief that exists within a 1m wide section across the tape and a 0.5m section along that tape that is centered over the point. Relief categories can be 0-10cm, 10cm-1m, 1-2m, and >2m\n",
    "- SUBSTRATE: Substrate type underlying each point. Substrate categories include bedrock , boulder, cobble, and sand and are further defined in the taxonomic table\n",
    "- SUPERLAYER: Superlayer includes a small subset of specific organisms which may be ephemeral, and tend to create a layer over primary space holders. Examples include low-lying, very large-bladed macroalgae such as Laminaria farlowii, brittle stars, and drift algae and in the Northern region abalone are recorded as a superlayer when occupying the space at the point. Not recorded at all points, only where present\n",

    "\n",
    "**These questions are in addition to those listed in PISCO_fish_transect_converstion.ipynb**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do I know if an organism was subsampled? Have counts already been adjusted to 60 m2? **Yes, counts have already been adjusted, so don't worry about it.**\n",
    "2. What's up with the transects that aren't just numbers ('1_E', '1_S', etc.)? Should I strip off the letters or leave them? **The actual transect numbers aren't meaningful - they're just different to denote replicates. Dan agrees that they are a bit confusing, but the research group would like to keep them.**\n",
    "3. There are 12 classcodes in the species table that do not appear in the swath or upc data. In addition, one classcode, LEPHEXAD, is missing from the species table. **This classcode refers to a Leptasterias adult. It will be changed to LEPHEX in the 2020 submission.**\n",
    "4. Sometimes, as in the fish data, NO_ORG observations occur in the same event as other observations. This does not make sense to me. **This should mean that no kelp was observed on the transect. Dan will confirm, and I can look into this as well. -- This does not appear to be correct, but there's only one NO_ORG record, and for now I've just excluded it. The wording in Dan's follow-up email was a bit confusing, but I think he's saying that he will drop this record for the next submission, too.**\n",
    "5. I did not find any size measurements for sea cucumbers, although the metadata says were sometimes sized. **This is fine; sea cucumber sizes can be found in the size frequency data.**\n",
    "6. As in the fish data, what is an appropriate coordinateUncertaintyInMeters? **250 m should be fine.**\n",
    "7. Is there a samplingEffort I can list for swath transects? UPC transects? Like a time goal or limit? **No. Since these transects represent a snapshot in time, and the organisms counted are sessile, it doesn't matter how long it takes someone to search the transect. It takes as long as it takes to survey everything that's there.**"
