    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does the \"method\" column actually relate to different survey methods? For example, here, method is always \"FISH\" and the only thing that's different is the campus information. **The method column does indicate some small changes in methodology, but these are not meaningful in the context of this data submission.**\n",
    "2. I assume depths were estimated by dive computer? **Yes**\n",
    "3. There are two sites in the site table that have no fish records: PISMO_W and SAL_E. **Someone decided these sites had invalid data. Dan will likely remove them from the site table.** The lat, lon for these sites are missing. The lat, lon for SCI_PELICAN_FAR_WEST are also missing. **Dan said he sent a new site table with the lat, lon for SCI_PELICAN_FAR_WEST, but it was not attached. NEED TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS.**\n",
    "4. There are 172 unique classcodes under sample type \"FISH\", but only 166 of them are actually in the fish data set. Classcodes that do not appear in the data are: DMAC, HSPI, HSTE, MXEN, and RBIN. Where does this discrepancy come from? **These should be non-UCSC, non-UCSB codes. Likely codes from very rare observations by VRG. Dan may tidy these up when he submits the 2020 data.**\n",
    "5. It seems like there are no absence records in this data, even though absence records could be formulated based on which species were looked for in a given year (as indicated by the species table). Is this correct? I draw this conclusion because the only record where count = NaN is eventID = PALO_COLORADO_20080904_OUTMID_BOT_2 (classcode = SACA). This record has been excluded for now, but it seems like it might be a data entry error? **Dropped is fine. It is correct that there are no absence records in this data set. However, Dan says that I should try to create the absence records using the looked for and not looked for information in the species table. He notes that he still has to generate a separate set of lines for campus=OSU, since these will be slightly different than UCSC. I'm not sure whether or how that will affect my analysis.**\n",
    "6. There are 12430 records where the classcode is \"NO_ORG.\" I assume these indicate empty transects, but as is, they are not useful as presence/absence data, and have been excluded. To make them useful, we would have to obtain whether or not the species was looked for during a given year, and add in 0 counts for the relevant transects, as discussed above. **Yes, NO_ORG indicates an empty transect. The looked for columns in the species table can be integrated with the observations to create absence records, as discussed above.**\n",
    "7. Sometimes, NO_ORG observations occur in the same event as other observations. This does not make sense to me. **The results from some early transects were recorded in 10 m segments, and some segments had NO_ORG if no fish were observed. These records can be dropped.**\n",
    "8. Should the unidentified fish (UNID) classcode match to Actinopterygii? Pisces? **Actinopterygii**\n",
    "9. In the species table, the classcode OYT matches to two species definitions: Sebastes serranoides/flavidus for HSU, UCSB, UCSC and Sebastes serranoides for VRG. I've assumed this is a mistake. **This is OK.**\n",
    "10. For data to be compatible with DwC standard, sex information must be entered using a controlled vocabulary. This vocabulary includes 'hermaphrodite' and 'indeterminate', but not something like 'transitional.' Do either of these terms seem reasonable? I can also potentially ask for the vocabulary to be expanded. **These fish are transitioning from female to male. They are sequential hermaphrodites that are protogynous. The designation 'indeterminate' might be reasonable. If it had to be simplified, say they're male, since they're about to be. Abby et al. suggested using hermaphrodite and clarifying in the metadata, since at the moment of observation, the fish has both male and female parts.**\n",
    "11. There are 234652 records with count = 1. Of these, 2843 have fish_tl = min_tl and max_tl missing. **All of these records are from HSU. I can assume that the fish_tl value is correct.** 287 have min_tl and max_tl specified, with fish_tl being an average of these values. This is confusing; I would expect all records with count = 1 to have fish_tl specified, and min_tl and max_tl missing. Can you clarify? **When a range of sizes has been given and count=1, someone couldn't make up their mind on how big the fish was. Use the average, fish_tl, as the best estimate.**\n",
    "12. Similarly, there are 134610 records with count > 1. Of these, 1786 have fish_tl = min_tl and max_tl missing. **These are from HSU too. Use fish_tl as the true length.** How do I interpret these records? \n",
    "13. coordinateUncertaintyInMeters? **250 is fine**\n",
    "14. Is there a samplingEffort I can list for fish transects? Like a time goal or limit? **Average 12 minutes**\n",
    "15. Can I assume sex/lifestage info in notes is accurate? **Yes, assume the notes are accurate. Assemble a file for Dan showing how I've extracted information from the notes. He has updated the data based on his file, and these changes will be reflected in the 2020 update.**"
